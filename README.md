Campus Helper is a full-stack web platform for university students to:

- Find and post part-time jobs and micro-tasks  
- Buy and sell study materials (books, notes, devices)  
- Join campus discussion forums  
- Chat with other students in (near) real time  
- Get smart help from an integrated **AI assistant**  

It started as a university project, but the goal is to build it with **production-style architecture** using **Next.js (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, **Supabase**, **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui**, and **Vercel**, following a **Scrum** workflow in **Jira**.

## 🧬 Architecture Overview

### App Structure

- **App Router** entry under `src/app`:
  - `(public)` – landing, marketing pages
  - `(auth)` – login, register
  - `(dashboard)` – authenticated area:
    - `jobs/`
    - `materials/`
    - `forum/`
    - `chat/`
    - `profile/`
    - `admin/` (reports, moderation)
    - `ai/` or AI assistant entry point

- Layouts:
  - `app/layout.tsx` – root shell (theme, fonts, base layout)
  - `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` – dashboard layout (navbar, sidebar, notifications, etc.)

### Feature Modules

- `features/jobs`
- `features/materials`
- `features/forum`
- `features/messaging`
- `features/notifications`
- `features/ratings`
- `features/admin` / `features/reports`
- `features/ai`

Each feature typically contains:

- `components/`
- `hooks/`
- `api/`
- `types/`
- `utils/`

### Data Access

- All DB access goes through the Supabase client in `lib/supabase.ts`
- (Optionally) feature-level API abstractions in:
  - `features/*/api/*.ts`

### Styling & Components

- `app/globals.css` for base resets and Tailwind layers
- `components/ui/*` for shared UI primitives (shadcn-generated + custom)
- `components/layout/*` for app-level layout pieces (navbar, page header, notification dropdown)
